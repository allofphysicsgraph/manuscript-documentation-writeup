\section{Introduction\label{sec:intro}}

The \pdg{} is an effort to write down the connective statements that span mathematical physics in a way that can be both read by humans and checked by a computer.
The \pdg{} provides a  schema for data and the associated software for systemizing  documentation of mathematical physics. 

This work yields novel results:
\begin{itemize}
    \item As a result of semantically enriching mathematical expressions, connections between topics is observable.
    \item Recurring mathematical operations are identified, referred to here as \glspl{inference rule}.
    \item The non-sequential dependencies in derivations are visualized.
    \item An ability to relate conventional Physics research to provable mathematical statements.
\end{itemize}
